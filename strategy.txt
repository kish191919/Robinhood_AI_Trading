[Music] hmm [Music] good afternoon and good evening and welcome to traders workshop today is thursday august 23rd and i'm really excited to have my next guest on traders workshop traders workshop where we bring in the experts from the ninja trader ecosystem talk about their experience and and talk about the markets with them real quick before we start i would like to remind everybody that futures and options trading contained substantial risk not for every trader you could potentially lose all or even more than all of your initial investments so that's why we recommend you use risk capital what is risk capital it's money that you can afford to lose doesn't keep you up at night and it doesn't extend your retirement horizon do you want to remind everybody that past performance is not indicative of future results and that what we talk about today in this show shouldn't be taken as trading advice nor financial investment recommendation but should be used for educational purposes only and with that it is my great pleasure and my uh total excitement to have one of the greats larry williams on tree at traders workshop larry how are you doing hey great tom thanks very much for having me here i've been looking forward to this is i was such a pleasure to be able to have your name in public places talking about what i love so i'm excited about this that's great yeah we're excited to have you here and and just so um we we level set where where are you calling in from larry red lodge montana okay and and is that where you stay uh for the summer is that uh that's that's where you do another place yeah the winter is pretty vicious up here in minecon i grew up here not far from red lodge but we spent the summers here and uh delightful good fishing beautiful clean air that's never been breathed before and uh a lot of friends of course from the past so enjoyed it a lot sounds sounds incredible uh you know just want to ask people who might not know you we do have a lot of new traders that come to our live streams can you just tell me a little bit about your background and how you got started in in the trading business sure it really began for me in 1962 i was in college and the stock market crashed president kennedy rolled back steel prices and the market crashed and i i didn't come from a family that ever owned stocks my dad worked in all refinery as i did in college and i said what does that mean and somebody said well if you would have bought this stock yesterday it went down a point or it went up a point you would have made a hundred dollars and a hundred dollars back in 1962 like about a thousand dollars now i said this is for me you just guess and you can make money you don't have to work in an oil refinery you don't have to work on a farm or a ranch like how do i do this and i've been trying to figure it out since 1962. that's 60 years now of uh looking at charts and so you're were you and did you go to school in montana no i first played football at byu and left there after my freshman year graduated eventually from the university of oregon a lot better football team with a degree in journalism and a minor in psychology right so i was going to ask if you're in montana or in 1962 certainly the trading landscape was a lot different than today right we didn't you didn't have the the access to all the information then so you you discovered where to go for that well that the wall street journal came about three days late back then maybe four days session time frames has changed so much because uh now it's instantaneous i know exactly how many stocks are advanced and declining right now thanks to ninjatrader i know exactly what's going on back then it was much slower so your reactionary time back then could be very slow now your after time is quite a bit great great um so i think you know i know a lot of people are here to hear they're here to hear you talk about the markets and and your experience but also you know how you use your indicators what you've developed to interpret the markets especially in a year like like this year i mean we talk about this in our shows have you seen a lot of anomalies or differences or is it just another trading year for you another it's another trading year we got a buy signal literally the week of the low the same indicator that a guy gave a buy signal it'd be weak at the low in 2020 at the kobe panic low so to me you know this is uh not an anomaly it's the markets like what markets do a lot of irrational activity a lot of it we can't understand can't figure out some we can and uh this year i think it's been pretty much our expectation down early in the year big strong rally coming starting it's already begun pull back in here then we move up higher great great um so real quick larry i do want to switch over you you had um very graciously prese uh prepared some some slides to help our viewers understand your thinking and your views on the market can we just jump right in is that all right absolutely let's do it let's go for it right so uh just the intro slide larry williams um if you want to just expound this interesting i think so many people have way too many indicators in their charts and they're all redundant if you look at my percent r bollinger percent b uh uh jerry pell's uh macd uh richard dyson stochastic they're all the same there's not an ounce of spit a difference between any of them and so indicators are terribly terribly redundant uh so i i think you have to break out of that people just put indicators on the charts because they can they're in the software uh you'd be really careful that i think you have to say what's the purpose of this indicator why is it there uh and then each indicator serves a specific purpose and that's going to help you in your journey of trying to trade or understand the markets so what can indicators do this is my thinking an indicator can show overbought oversold one can show momentum one can identify the trend for when the trend is changing uh in for money i'm real clear after six years of doing this there's more money in the marketplace and we can figure out when they're buying we've got a pretty good idea when they're buying or selling uh so that's a tremendous indicator to help us understand what most likely will happen in the future and then cycles i really believe in cycles i think that the markets are cyclical that things are i don't know if they're quite predestined tom but uh there's a cadence to how things happen so i definitely pay a lot of attention to cycles let's look at those right now in a little bit of the ten minutes bar chart if you're gonna love to see that we can see we get a glimpse of the future uh price patterns there's certain patterns not the heads and shoulders and the type of stuff but they're they're patterns that i like to see in the market that suggest what may happen and then value i i think that basically markets move from here to here because of fundamentals valuation fundamentals they go like this because of emotions that's where technical stuff comes in here but from point a to point b that's fundamental that markets are fundamentally driven that's why they exist and you have to look at both the fundamental aspect and the technical or the emotional aspect of trading so larry there's a lot you you just said and with the redundancy that i you know in my experience i've seen traders have redundant indicators like you said with the momentum indicators but this is a different thing this is trying to maybe uh complement these these indicators could complement each other rather than being the redundancy that you mentioned with macd and and stochastics et cetera yeah clearly even all those indicators were developed about the same time uh jerry oppel of course a dear friend of mine dyson uh of course i knew popularized by a couple other people but we all developed these ideas in the in the mid 1960s some a little bit earlier than that and we didn't really understand what we were doing and finally i realized no each indicator one should show accumulation once you show over a bottle or so one can show this and then you have a packet of indicators that help you understand the market as opposed to oh here's an overbought oversold indicator looked at the divergence which doesn't work very well so to me i'm a conditional trader i look for conditions when these indicators usually come together that's a condition that will cause an up move or a down move so i'm i'm not a technical trader really i look for conditions and that's why each indicator needs to be different otherwise they're just redundant thanks for that that's great that's great so i'm just going to move along wow this is in memory because i i think most of these indicators we should get rid of mine as well you know that we have to be really careful about uh people will show me their computers and the old day they're trusting oh my gosh this morning just get rid of some of this stuff simplifying that's all right and you you know i get exposed to a lot of that now with with after covid and we're all remote or we're starting to get in person but i see it a lot on social media too when people are becoming more forthcoming with their charts and you just see oh you know so much on the charts i can't i turn off i don't want to read it yeah and what are they doing i i read today somebody's bearish in the market because the sunny indicator is overbought so we'll be i mean you know just an overbite indicator might mean we're going to go higher so you have to understand the indicators as well it's it's not a simplistic thing that's why if you know oh this purpose does this indicator has this purpose for me then you can put all this stuff into perspective the right perspective sure well this is really important i think it's best for ninja people if you look at the trading championships and i won one back in 1987 to 10 000 real time real money to 1.1 million dollars in real trading uh and most often these championships are won by my students but my daughter won one in 1997 she took ten thousand dollars two hundred and ten thousand dollars real time real money real trading um when you look at if you look at these championships they're usually broken down in stocks forex options and futures and i looked at the results which group has the largest percentage gains year in and year out and it's really interesting because consistently the winner of these championships the largest gains have come from futures trading now you'd think that would be options or forex because they have the the best margin ability they can get the best bang for their buck and stocks aren't surprising because you can't get a lot of bang for your buck with even using margin there but to see that the consistent profits and these have been substantial 2 300 a year in these trading championships 600 a year in the trading championships by and large it's come from future trading not trading forex options or stocks now that tells me that's where i want to focus that you know clearly the lower hanging fruit and this trading business seems to be from futures interesting yeah and and you know we love to hear that obviously being a ninja trader focusing on the futures market is that a matter of you know the amount of leverage you get as well or is it you think it's more about the bigger you know i could see an argument for futures are generally broader based assets right you're not looking at a a penny stock or a you know a very specific stock you're looking at some things more there might be more information about it i don't know i i think there's more reliable data forex can get really emotional uh options same problem that you could get too much of a bang for your buck so you get blown out real quickly and it looks like in terms of the marginal ability futures about right plus we have the commitment of trader report we have crop reports we have a lot of history in these markets so i think that they're more manageable not saying any market's very manageable but they're more manageable than the others that we have better data very very uh a better idea of fundamentals in these in future markets than we do the other markets sure sure um so you know let's move along i think right uh i think we've gone there so you know after 15 years of trading championships we have about that many years of trading championship a little bit longer that's clearly what we're told is that the the money has come from the future traders they've always had the best performance not every year but like 95 percent of the years they've outperformed any of the trading opportunities so that tells us where we should focus yeah yep so to maximize indicators we need to understand how the market works i want to start to explain part of how i have found the market to work it's just my view and a lot of other views about how the markets work but this is mine which is pretty much a i'm a mechanical guy pretty mechanistic guy so let's look at the next slide and i'll show you how i think markets move and this is important to understand how to trade and how indicators work clearly markets go from little ranges to big ranges and trading range to a trend move if you will um so that means that if there's a big trend move i probably don't want to be involved i want to wait until the markets settle down their small ranges then my indicators will work better because i know the market will move up or down and not so certainly direction yet but i know that i have a trend move coming which is what i want to get involved in most traders see a trend move and get involved just when the trend ends the other thing that really helps understand how markets work is that market tops consistently happen with the large close to low the markets close way off their low that's how markets top clearly any time frame weekly monthly daily inter day the reverse is equally true markets bottom closing on their low so they have a very large high to close and that's how markets bottom now most people see that and get emotional and start to sell at the bottoms and buy at the tops so once you understand that i think we have some charts we're going to look at that uh let's go to our next slide tom uh more and more of how markets move we go from congestion to creation which is really small ranges to large ranges and this is really interesting we go small open to close look at your charts you'll see this the market have a small open to close small open or closed then a day later a very large range large move from the opening to the close so that's where the money is going to be made so if i see small net change open or close i can prepare for a large trend move coming and we'll look at the next sharp now in the u shape the markets are really shaped on the inner day let me show that on the next chart i think that's where we are tom yeah this is this is the s p e minis and notice at the bottom i have the volume and notice how u-shaped that is there's a lot of volume earlier in the session volume dries up and there's a lot of volume in the end of the session now if you could do the same chart with the average daily range and you'll see the same thing because after all range is driven by volume so the markets intraday start big it's like everybody goes to work in the morning on the freeway they're all busy and there's not much traffic on the freeway then everybody goes home and a lot of traffic on the freeway the day after day after day as long as i've been trading that's how markets actually move into a day which tells us is traders oh i can see opportunities in the morning and i see opportunities towards the end of the day the middle of the day is just you know there's no man's land not much is going on so once you understand the markets are you shaped it's going to help you as a short-term trader and larry we talk about that a little bit on our on our bars closing show because we're looking we call it the volume smile right and we look for that smile to be completed so when we start the show it's 3 15 you've got about on a 10 minute chart you've got about four or five candles left and the volume doesn't kick in until the those last you know two or three candles but it really is fun to watch when we try to complement what happened at the beginning of the day with the end of the day volume and remember that volume drives range so that the ranges are larger at the end of the day and at the first of the day and that's where the trading we need large ranges we need volatility at short-term traders let's take a look at our next slide tom sure so the marcus u-shape that means there's times of opportunity which is what we're just talking about and you guys have talked about with your smile so a day trader what i've seen with day trading and people think they can make money every day day trading and not every day is the same so i'm looking for unique days that should have explosive moves to the upside that's what i want um and i'm going to show in a little bit how we hold on and how we trade those actually trade those days uh so all days are not the same we have to be very careful all right to find that opportunity uh yeah so do we know market tops often take place with price closing at or near the high of the day or week this is really important for short-term traders i'm going to show you in just a moment why you really need to burn this idea into your mind that if you if the market starts to rally it will close close to the high of the day or you know the decline is going to close close to a low day most all of the time now our next slide i think might put this drive this home yeah so if we close near the higher the low and here's an actual example of it you can see the very first blue zone up there look how the market topped in the fnp we had three days consistently closing right after high and that was a market top if you look at the market lows in the blue balloons if you will the market's closing right on the lows and that's what i'm looking for to be a buyer is markets closing on the lows as opposed to looking like oh the market looks real strong if you look just before this first of august we had a really strong day close right in the high the next day is the high of the market before it starts to decline again so i'm very uh focused on where mark is closed during the day and that means a lot to day traders let's go to our next slide um and this is what i think one of the really big takeaways in my life is trading and then understand it seems pretty simple but looking back on it it took a while to figure this out trend is the basis of all profits no trend no profits i mean we all understand that you've got to have some type of a trend move however what causes trend what's the function of trend that was the breakthrough for me and the secret is what caused it or what trend well here it is it's on our next slide trend is a function of time the more time you're going to trade the more opportunity for a trend so time is our favor time is an ally for us i want time in a trade the more time i can get the larger my trend move in theory profits can be so uh time is really really critical to me even on a very short term basis so i think i can show that i think we have that on the next slide let's take a look at that this is why day trading is so tough is because our next slide um most of the time the price is a consolidation it's a wavy about 15 of the time and it trades about trends about 15 percent of time so we have to catch that 15 of the time and we don't know when the market's going to trend we have an idea we don't know for sure so the market can tell us that and i think that's in our next slide this is the day traders dilemma by definition you can't catch large trend moves because you limit you have four hours five hours to make money that's it whereas a holding position i'm going to hold overnight i could have 15 20 30 days i think it's a really big trend which means that i can bet small and catch a big move and make a lot of money whereas if i bet small and lose i'm going to lose small our next slide i think shows the opposite of that and just to be clear you know we're talking about past performance um you know these are ideas that certainly make sense right because we talk about it larry just on our show the morning show we have all day so we we talk freely about ideas and we don't limit ourselves in time and at the end of our show we we kind of use the end of the day as our trading day so our our ideas about trading ideas going into the end of the trading day are limited because of that very thing we don't have time we put that time restriction on ourself as part of the show but a traitor can do that too right if you're saying i'm not carrying a position i only have so much time at the end of the day to look for that 15 of the time getting a trend and i think most day traders feel like there's a lot of fear of holding overnight they don't want to hold overnight for whatever reason actually if you do the math on it you'll see that most market moves occur from the close to the prior opening the opening to the close is not as much of the move trend move say in the dow jones industrial average or sp500 as the opening of the night's opening to the following close so you really have to be careful and understand where the move comes from um but and here's the critical point for date real short-term traders these large-range days that's when we get a trend an intraday trend like you're talking about they close on their streams which means let's go to our next slide i think it's going to drive home the point look at these large range days in the bond market the very last one where we close right on the low go back to the little blue dot before that closing the low before that on the low so whenever you get a large range date most often you're going to close on the extreme of the day which means as a short-term trader if i get a winning trade on i want to hold i don't want to try to dance in and out catch a little here a little there i want to try to catch the trend move which means hold to the close i think we've got some more there it is httc hold to the close in my view and this is just my theoretical view of the marketplace my experience of trading the the larger money is made by holding to the close i don't want to catch inner day swings i'm times my ally i want the trade to run one of my really good traders brian shad was a navy seal and i was in san diego at the time and brian was a steel and training uh deep diving steel and brian whenever i talked to him he'd always say hold of the gloves because he finally did enough trading that he busted out of the steel and became a full-time trader um but it's the only way you can catch a big trend movement or day here's my point to catch a big move in her day you gotta hold to their clothes and we know most always these large trend days do close in an extreme so that's how you trade it and and larry so holding to the close let's take a normal regular trading hours on the s p or the russell or the e-mini dow are we are you ex finding a trade setup in the first half hour and again we can talk about this or uh in the first half hour in the first hour obviously if we hold to the close we have all day and that that gives us like you said more time to let it run but are you just as excited about something that happens in the in the middle of the day as long as you're identifying as the same setups are occurring if that makes sense well yeah if you i think markets call my freight train theory markets start to move and to continue moving in that direction okay so if you see a decent break out in the middle of the day while it's really good because we know the traffic is going to pick up the end of your smile so yeah i like to see strength is usually followed by strength charlie francisco the largest bond trader in the history of the world was a friend of mine and i asked charlie dee one time said tom uh charlie how do you work tom demarco never always said how do you do this he said this is what i do i walk around the pit i'll trade a thousand here a thousand there just having fun by listening for the noise and when it's real noisy i see what the trend has been if the trend is down i sell 10 15 000 bonds and i'll take a couple three ticks profit on it maybe five ticks and if it's real noisy and i hear that i look at the trend that trends up i buy because the idea is like a train is going down a track and the conductor pulls an emergency brake the train doesn't come to a stop but it stops it can't stop that quick you got that much noise and charlie's because he was a four trader that much momentum going you're going to have a little bit of follow-through enough that usually you're going to be able to get some type of an opportunity there okay interesting um i think you you you know in in prep for this i was able to look at your slides and i think you have a really interesting uh uh you know example coming up um let's just move to it i think this is a great great slide well i found a study that was done at 30 million trades and of uh commodity traders and they traders were right more often than they were wrong in other words their accuracy was they were more than 50 of the time they were correct but they lost money so let's look at our next slide i think that might show why yeah uh and this was really interesting um on a 12-month sample period half of all the accounts that i had a one-to-one risk reward to ratio turn to net profit those under a one-to-one only 19 of them made money so you're per trade how much your average profit per trade is is huge these guys on balance were right more often than they were wrong but they lost money they're looking at 30 million trades in the marketplace the ones that made money their average loss was at least equal or smaller than their average gain so that's a critical number people say larry how accurate is your system i don't care i'm sure this isn't 99 accurate it loses money money on a winning trade one huge losing trade it loses money so accuracy is important and it's not as critical as the average profit per trade your average winning trade needs to be at least equal to or greater than your average losing trade that's the mathematical performance of the marketplace right and and larry it seems so simple right i may you have more winning trades than not or when i win i win more than not but it's so important to focus on that risk ratio because of that because it seems like it's such a fine-tuned instrument or fine-tune uh measure that you know it gets a little out of whack and you could go from being like you said profitable to non-profitable you know successful to non-successful pretty quickly yeah real quickly and i would follow up on that any book by ralph vince on money management the must reap he's the the the brain behind all the money management schemes that have been developed he's got the best of them and and clearly there's three or four important points accuracy kind of important it's not the only thing though but that average win to average loss it's huge that's the number you got to focus on great so this is how my trading philosophy of money management i bet small i have a small position uh maybe 10 contracts in the s p and i'm hoping to catch a larger move that's going to last for maybe three days 15 20 30 days so i can catch a huge move potentially to the upside and if i lose i'm just going to lose back that a relatively small amount versus a potential reward that's the risk reward ratio we just talked about that's how you do it we never been really big in this business okay well let's go back to indicators for a little bit most indicators are the same you got to be careful of that i want to make sure the indicator serves a different purpose so let's start looking at some indicators this is really important i did this like tom did see that i used to have one of those when i started you really got involved in the markets uh now it's 1965. and that's how we did math there were no yeah some people young kids can't understand we didn't have calculators you'd punch in the numbers and pull down that crank and go choke choke check would print out the answer now why that's important is because all of the indicators that everything is based on his entire business are 10-day moving averages 20-day moving averages 100-day moving averages 200-day moving average why because those machines couldn't divide they only added so a 10-day moving average just move the decimal point over one a 20-day moving average you multiply by two you can do that on the machine 100-day average well it's 100 days you move it over that's all so these indicators were all developed with this in the 1930s to the about 1970 before we really had what we now know as calculators so the time frames and the construction of the basic indicators this entire business are because of this machine and we didn't have 31 day moving averages or 27 and a half day we didn't have any of that and this tradition is carried through we're still 10 day 20 days occasion you see a 14 day average why is that because some people back then thought that's half the lunar cycle 28 days of course there's 28 calendar days not trading days but indicators were based on those time frames the time frame from the adding machine and from nothing else and larry you've just you've just solved the riddle because as somebody who's grown up with uh you know different platforms like ninjatrader you have access to any kind of time period so you think what is it a 50 period well that's that's two and a half months why two and a half months right or or a hundred days that's five months why is five months this explains all of that that's i that's my aha moment from this this show right here larry you've you've solved the riddle i love it yeah it's like that's because it was easy to do it that way right right no that's great i love it letters before the internet we just got letters and somebody emailed me or sent a letter one day and i opened up a letter it says how many days are in a 10-day moving average the person wanted to know and i wrote back and said well who's buried in grant's tomb and then i got a letter back from him said why are you being smart with me but we've moved from that and now you can put in oh my gosh it's so much easier to figure i i hired people that would come in after the markets closed and run on this adding machine tabulations and notebooks to get our indicators you know we've come a long way baby from there yeah i mean i i heard stories most of your day or or a technical analyst back in the day most of the day was spent accumulating and putting the data together right at the end of the day if i was traveling like i would be doing the next couple days i'd have to call my broker write down high low call volume in my notebook keep track of that i'm encouraged i traveled big notebooks uh to keep all the data and i had people employed it did nothing but add numbers up at the end of the day yes it's changed a lot that's amazing so let's let's jump to the next slide i want to be mindful of time and i do want to see some of the charts to explain what what we were doing but let's see these are things i think indicators can do a little read that big show cycles major accumulation which is really important show professional buying short trend chain but yeah let's i think we've got some charts uh let's go to the charts with more people with just powerpoints here uh sure um let me let me just uh yeah why don't you talk and i'll get the charts ready i'm okay so this is a cycle forecast that i did uh yesterday this is the s p on a 10 minute bar chart the gold line at the bottom of the chart that's simply my cycle forecast it's an indicator based on cycles i developed this 15 years ago maybe it's a combination of the three most active short-term cycles and notice it goes way out into the right it goes up 66 bars in the future and it suggests what price should do so when the market started to decline on the left side of the chart there look what the indicator was doing it's coming down and down and down saying yeah we would expect the market to come down now tom's going to pick up it remember this is the forecast from yesterday but it looked like a rally should start to start later in the day so let's go to the 10-minute chart of that okay let me see i did have a ten minute i'm trying to follow up on that from the uh so it looked like the market started to bounce come down into a low and then start to rally that that's nice because most indicators just say well they showed the past there it is the chart you're looking at the bottom now you can see exactly what happened we had that bounce come up and look where we are now we have a projection as the market should now start to rally so this gives a view of the future most indicate almost all indicators show what happened in the past they don't show what happens in the future and that's where cycles can be really helpful like oh right now if i'm a short-term trader i can see the market been pretty much falling the cyclical little forecast and it looks like it's time to look for the market to now rally so that and that's a 10-minute chart on the e-mini right now yeah now this is really interesting because i first did this on a daily chart of apple and then i went to inner date charts and i found that it works there as well it'll vary though to be clear about this sometimes it works better on a 15 minute bar chart sometimes a 10-minute bar chart but it doesn't take you know click a button and you see oh yeah it's really in phase with 10-minute or 15-minute those tend to be the most the dominant ones and it works pretty well in a daily chart as well it gives me a pretty good idea of when in the future we can see markets rallying decline so you see where we are right now you can see where the forecast was and mark came down and seen bounce in here they put that on a daily chart we may have that in the powerpoint slides as well yeah so um [Music] sorry about that let's see what happened there i think i grabbed it put it on a different uh let me do this here we go so right now we saw a load and we saw that low and the pickup move came now starts this yes we should start to pull down until about the end of september and that's when i would look for a cyclical bounce to the upside in the marketplace is a perfect node does it give me a pretty good idea when to expect highs and lows and more oh yeah it does so yeah we can have a short-term bounce in here but the next really significant move based on just this it's just there you go middle the end of september typically and the next time i think we're going to do one more this time and have a trade for people in september there's usually a sell-off at the end of september and in our next presentation i'm going to identify them great great now um we looked at uh the e-mini on these but we can look at these on any market right i think they have crews do you put on crude oil and put on bitcoin put it on you know and again there it is that's uh crude oil so you saw yeah we should have a rally we start to come down we came down now look what's our gap and i suggest we should start to have a strong advance in the market and lo and behold that's what started to happen here so it it's a suggestion you can't go based just on this clearly but it says ah i want to get ready here get ready there then other things can confirm say uh-huh yeah it's time to pull the trigger for this trade and to be clear this this as you mentioned this is based on different cycles yes uh different cycle cycle time per periods and so it is it's um using historical data to suggest what might happen going forward exactly the time frames i don't even recall what they are now it's been so many years ago since i developed this but there's probably like a you know a seven day 20 day and maybe a 30 day time frame and then they're weighted because the nearby cycle is more important than say one from 30 days ago so there's a little waiting that goes on into them nothing fancy because i don't have a mathematical background but it's just a combination of those cycles and it's you know for something i did 15 20 years ago it's really surprising how this has held up pretty well to say when we should start to see moves in the marketplace well and larry to that point i mean this is what's um interesting about technical indicator indicators is because we always think we're living in the next new normal or this time it's different right how many times have you heard this times it's different but this shows that well you know what this might not be different it's just like every other cycle or you know there's a suggestion there that cycles do repeat regardless of what's happening uh around us well the one consistent thing in market books if you go back and read the books uh in the late 1890s the early 1910s 1940s 1960s even now they'll say well the marcus is really complex right now oh no it's always the same our ability to deal with the markets uh yeah i think the markets are consistently erratic um right and they are driven by fundamentals if we keep those two north stars in mind as to what's happening in the marketplace and understanding how markets move they simply become simpler to trade sure i want to take a look at wheat you had a wheat chart up here so you know really interesting with wheat with what again i'm going to go back to what's been going on right it's it's new uh interesting times for us with what's going on in eastern europe uh and how that affects wheat i think there's something going on in china that might affect wheat prices but cycles don't care well yeah and here's here's a real big point though you have to understand about cycles is they don't predict the magnitude their only timing so right now the cycle forecast and we looks like a huge room to the upside meaningless to me it means we'll have a move to the upside it does not tell us how big just like i remember we're looking now 66 days three months into the future the peak that we saw in june of this year was clearly identified by the cycle forecast that the peak right below in the or in the cycle forecast line that was known 66 days prior to the market topping out just so we now see the future direction anticipated future direction but it didn't say how big the market move would come the magnitude of the move comes from other things from the fundamentals of the marketplace so the fact we see a huge moved cyclical move swing to the upside that means the mark will move that big and it's a rally and then you have to use your own skills as a trader your understanding of other indicators see how significant this move might become and could you could you use this um strength as a gauge of how sure you might be or how how you feel about that move no okay no great that that's where cycle people get in trouble to see a big 48 month is in the stock market is a huge 48 month cycle pattern and sometimes you have big moves sometimes we don't the size of the cyclical swing because it just measures the top to bottom and cycles really are about trend about time 28 days 56 days whatever the day period is they say this is a zone they don't predict this way you have to be very careful you don't predict magnitude sure great great so i have a gold chart up uh now i'm switching to a different set of charts that have different indicators you mentioned um you know you have a whole suite of indicators and uh if anybody uh we'll we'll talk about it at the end and how everybody can access this and we're looking at a chart that has different indicators can you explain what's going on with this sure the green line is a measure of accumulation in the marketplace and so we can see how price is holding up versus the black line versus accumulation uh notice right in the middle of the chart about june uh the market had a real strong day closed right outside the next day it tanked but that big guy remember we talked yeah we talked about marcus close closing on the high is bearish right that's how they top out and we see that the green line did not make new eyes in there which suggesting there wasn't a follow-through of volume it was actually downs are up the market there's been distribution in the market just like at the lows earlier you saw the market have been coming down in there but we started to see divergence between accumulation and price and the original work for this was done by uh woods and magnolia uh husband white team in san francisco my good friend joe granville popularized this with calling to on balance on balance volume and but in the future market he's on balance bond for a long time you know what we're missing something we're missing open interest so i added in this formula a measurement of price accumulation uh volume accumulation and open interest accumulation and this has been a pretty good job just at the lows that we saw this year just a couple of months ago the green line's not making a new low while price is so the accumulation is coming to the marketplace and we should be biased to the long side of the market so that's helpful to see what's happening short-term accumulation the combination of price open interest and volume all in one tool the blue line at the bottom is the seasonal impact of gold that's a seasonal pattern the gold usually is usually traveled the way it's usually traded throughout the years big difference of in my seasonal pattern and i wrote the first book on seasonals in commodities way back in the 1970s that was the foundation for all the seasonal work that you do now and i did it wrong i use the seasonal pattern and everybody's repeated my air the williams air is the seasonal pattern in all seasonal books right now for now look the same as they did say in 1920 because we get the seasonal pattern up through today and we'll push it back in time but you didn't have today's data back then so my true seasonal looks at season price activity just up to today and there's been a huge change like you know this thing um selling may and go away and the dow jones industrial average actually that used to be the best time of the year to buy oh well by in may until the federal reserve really got control of things about 1950 that was a good time to buy so the the problem if you're doing research and trying to understand the market if you use the traditional seasonal pattern that would push the pattern back in time you're going to get some wrong conclusions so my seasonal pattern looks and just notice that we should start to see a rally as we did at the last year when we saw the accumulation divergence right and there's that time to really good we've seen short-term accumulation coming in and a seasonal low in the market makes sense to look for some type of trade to break out trend line whatever you're using as a trading opportunity wow that's interesting that's great and you know it's about your seasonality the true seasonality true seasonal study when did you when did you revise that was that uh recently or was that uh that was about uh maybe 10 years ago wow uh you know the 1970 book kicked off plethora a whole cottage industry of seasonal studies and virtually everybody was doing the same thing and one day uh i woke up said you know what the seasonal patterns that were different back then than it is now what's going on here and that's when i have the realization that i did it wrong and everybody followed my footsteps i took everybody down the wrong path and uh so this is what i now understand is that we really need to have that seasonal pattern so what was true then not what's true now right right great larry um i hate to do this we're over time and there's so much more to talk about i know you could
